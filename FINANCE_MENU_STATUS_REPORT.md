## 🌐 To Access the System

1. Start the Laravel development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

2. Open your browser and go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/admin
    ```

3. Login with your admin credentials

4. The Finance menu should appear in the sidebar with a banknotes icon

## 📋 Database Schema

The Finance module uses the existing `finances` table with these columns:

-   `id` (primary key)
-   `student_id` (foreign key to students table)
-   `date` (transaction date)
-   `amount` (decimal amount)
-   `type` (transaction type)
-   `description` (optional description)
-   `status` (payment status)
-   `due_date` (optional due date)
-   `payment_date` (optional payment date)
-   `created_at`, `updated_at` (timestamps)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the Finance menu doesn't appear:

1. Clear caches again:

    ```bash
    php artisan config:clear
    php artisan cache:clear
    php artisan route:clear
    php artisan view:clear
    ```

2. Check file permissions (ensure web server can read the files)

3. Check Laravel logs for any errors:

    ```bash
    tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
    ```

4. Verify that Filament is properly installed and configured

## ✨ The Finance menu is now ready and should be visible in your Filament admin panel!
