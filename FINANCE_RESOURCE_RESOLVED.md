# Finance Resource Issue - RESOLVED âœ…

## Problem Summary

The Finance menu was not appearing in the Filament admin panel due to file encoding issues that prevented the FinanceResource class from being properly loaded.

## Root Cause

The FinanceResource.php file was being created with improper UTF-8 encoding that included a Byte Order Mark (BOM), causing PHP syntax errors that prevented Filament from registering the resource.

## Solution Applied

1. **Removed all duplicate FinanceResource files** that were causing class declaration conflicts
2. **Recreated FinanceResource.php with proper ASCII encoding** using PowerShell to avoid BOM issues
3. **Added Finance to navigation groups** in AdminPanelProvider.php
4. **Simplified the resource structure** with modern Filament v3 syntax

## Final Status

âœ… **FinanceResource is now properly registered and visible in the admin panel**

## FinanceResource Features

## Files Modified

## How to Access

1. Go to `/admin` in your browser
