echo "=== BEFORE vs AFTER COMPARISON ===\n\n";

echo "❌ OLD STRUCTURE LIMITATIONS:\n";
echo "• Each student had ONE assigned instructor for ALL sessions\n";
echo "• No grading per session - only overall tracking\n";
echo "• Instructor workload was not flexible\n";
echo "• Limited scheduling options\n";
echo "• No session-specific feedback\n\n";

echo "✅ NEW STRUCTURE BENEFITS:\n";
echo "• Each SESSION has an assigned instructor\n";
echo "• Individual grading per session\n";
echo "• Flexible instructor scheduling\n";
echo "• Better instructor workload distribution\n";
echo "• Session-specific feedback and notes\n\n";

echo "🔍 PRACTICAL EXAMPLE:\n";

// Get sample data to demonstrate
$student = Student::with(['package'])->first();
$instructor1 = Instructor::first();
$instructor2 = Instructor::skip(1)->first();

echo "Student: {$student->name}\n";
echo "Package: {$student->package->name}\n\n";

echo "Session Schedule with Different Instructors:\n";

    ->orderBy('order')

        ->where('session_id', $session->id)

    echo "   📝 Feedback: {$studentSession->instructor_feedback}\n";
    echo "   ⏰ Status: {$studentSession->status}\n";
    echo "\n";
}

echo "🎯 FLEXIBILITY DEMONSTRATION:\n";
echo "Notice how:\n";
echo "• Sessions 1-2 are taught by {$sessions[0]->instructor->name}\n";
echo "• Sessions 3-4 are taught by {$sessions[2]->instructor->name}\n";
echo "• Each session has individual scoring and feedback\n";
echo "• Different instructors can focus on their specialties\n\n";

echo "📈 INSTRUCTOR WORKLOAD ANALYSIS:\n";
$instructors = Instructor::withCount('sessions')->get();

foreach ($instructors as $instructor) {
    echo "👨‍🏫 {$instructor->name}: {$instructor->sessions_count} sessions assigned\n";

    // Count total students across all their sessions
    $totalStudents = 0;
    foreach ($instructor->sessions as $session) {
        $totalStudents += $session->students()->count();
    }
    echo "   📚 Teaching {$totalStudents} student sessions\n";
    echo "\n";
}

echo "🔄 MIGRATION BENEFITS:\n";
echo "✓ Better resource utilization\n";
echo "✓ Specialized instruction per session type\n";
echo "✓ Individual progress tracking\n";
echo "✓ Flexible scheduling capabilities\n";
echo "✓ Detailed performance analytics\n";
echo "✓ Instructor expertise optimization\n\n";

echo "🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION!\n";
echo "The restructured system is now ready for use with enhanced flexibility and tracking capabilities.\n";
