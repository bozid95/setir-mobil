## 💰 **HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS NOW**

### **Simple Payment Flow**

1. **Add Payment**: Create individual Finance record
2. **Set Details**: Amount, type, due date, description
3. **Track Status**: pending → paid (manually marked)
4. **View Dashboard**: Monitor all payments via widgets

### **For Installments (Manual Creation)**

Instead of automatic installment generation, users manually create multiple Finance records:

```
Student John Doe - Tuition 4,000,000 IDR (4 installments):

Finance #1: tuition, 1,000,000, due: 2025-07-01, "Tuition 1/4"
Finance #2: tuition, 1,000,000, due: 2025-08-01, "Tuition 2/4"
Finance #3: tuition, 1,000,000, due: 2025-09-01, "Tuition 3/4"
Finance #4: tuition, 1,000,000, due: 2025-10-01, "Tuition 4/4"
```

### **Payment Types & Use Cases**

-   **Registration**: One-time enrollment fee
-   **Tuition**: Course fees (can be split manually)
-   **Material**: Books, manuals, equipment
-   **Exam**: Test and assessment fees
-   **Certificate**: License issuance fee
-   **Penalty**: Late payment or violation fees

## 📊 **DATABASE STRUCTURE**

### **Finance Table (Simplified)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE finances (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id BIGINT FOREIGN KEY,
    date DATETIME,           -- Payment creation date
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),    -- Payment amount
    type VARCHAR(50),        -- Payment category
    description TEXT,        -- Payment details
    status VARCHAR(20),      -- pending/paid/cancelled
    due_date DATE,           -- When payment should be paid
    payment_date DATETIME,   -- When actually paid (nullable)
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP
);
```
