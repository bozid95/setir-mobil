## 🗄️ Database Structure

### Tables Added/Modified

#### `finances` Table (Enhanced)

```sql
- student_id (FK to students)
- payment_type (enum: 'full', 'installment')
- total_installments (int, nullable)
- total_amount (decimal, for installments)
- paid_amount (decimal, tracks payments made)
- remaining_amount (decimal, calculated field)
- start_date (date, first installment due date)
```

#### `installments` Table (New)

```sql
- id (primary key)
- student_id (FK to students)
- finance_id (FK to finances)
- installment_number (int: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- amount (decimal: installment amount)
- due_date (date: when payment is due)
- paid_date (date, nullable: when actually paid)
- status (enum: 'pending', 'paid', 'overdue', 'cancelled')
- notes (text, nullable)
```

## 📈 Business Logic

### Installment Generation

```php
// Automatically creates installments when finance record is saved
$finance->generateInstallments();

// Example: Rp 800,000 in 4 installments = Rp 200,000 each
// Due dates: Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4
```

### Payment Processing

```php
// Mark installment as paid
$installment->markAsPaid();

// Update parent finance record
$finance->updatePaidAmount();

// Automatic calculation of remaining balance
```

### Status Management

-   **Pending**: Installment is due but not yet paid
-   **Paid**: Installment has been paid (with paid_date)
-   **Overdue**: Pending installment past due date
-   **Cancelled**: Installment cancelled/voided
