# DRIVING SESSIONS STRUCTURE FIX - COMPLETED âœ…

## Problem Resolved

**Issue**: `SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'order' in 'field list'` when creating driving sessions.

**Root Cause**: The `driving_sessions` table was missing required columns (`order` and `title`) that the Session model was trying to use.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Schema Updates âœ…

Added missing columns to `driving_sessions` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE driving_sessions ADD COLUMN `order` INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 AFTER instructor_id;
ALTER TABLE driving_sessions ADD COLUMN `title` VARCHAR(255) NULL AFTER `order`;
```

### 2. Migration Status âœ…

-   Migration `2025_06_13_164754_add_missing_columns_to_driving_sessions_table.php` marked as completed
-   All pending migrations resolved

### 3. Verification Results âœ…

#### Database Structure

```
driving_sessions table now contains:
- id (bigint unsigned) - Primary key
- name (varchar(255)) - Session name
- description (text) - Session description
- package_id (bigint unsigned) - Links to package
- instructor_id (bigint unsigned) - Links to instructor
- order (int) - NEW: Session order/sequence
- title (varchar(255)) - NEW: Session title
- duration_minutes (int) - Session duration
- is_active (tinyint(1)) - Active status
- created_at/updated_at (timestamp) - Timestamps
```

#### Functionality Test

âœ… **PASSED**: Successfully created test driving session with all fields including `order` and `title`
