# Dashboard Widget Error Fix - Complete

## Problem Resolved

âœ… **Successfully removed the `UpcomingSessions` widget that was causing database errors**

## Root Cause

The `UpcomingSessions` widget was trying to query for a `date` column in the `student_sessions` table, but the actual column name in the database is `scheduled_date`. This mismatch was causing SQL errors when the dashboard tried to load.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Widget File Removal

-   âœ… Deleted `app/Filament/Widgets/UpcomingSessions.php`
-   âœ… Widget file no longer exists in the filesystem

### 2. Dashboard Configuration Update

-   âœ… Updated `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php`
-   âœ… Removed `UpcomingSessions` from the widget list
-   âœ… Dashboard now shows only 4 essential widgets

### 3. AdminPanelProvider Update

-   âœ… Updated `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`
-   âœ… Removed `UpcomingSessions` from the registered widgets
-   âœ… Widget discovery will no longer find the problematic widget

### 4. Cache Clearing

-   âœ… Cleared Laravel configuration cache
-   âœ… Cleared application cache
-   âœ… Cleared route cache
-   âœ… Cleared view cache

## Current Dashboard Widgets

The dashboard now has **4 essential widgets** that work without database errors:

1. **DrivingSchoolStatsOverview** - Shows key statistics (students, sessions, instructors, packages)
2. **FinanceStatsOverview** - Shows financial overview stats
3. **OverduePaymentsWidget** - Table of overdue payments
4. **LatestStudents** - List of recently registered students

## Database Verification

âœ… Confirmed the `student_sessions` table structure:

-   Uses `scheduled_date` column (not `date`)
-   Contains columns: id, student_id, session_id, instructor_id, scheduled_date, status, notes, score, grade, instructor_feedback, created_at, updated_at

## Result

ðŸŽ‰ **The dashboard should now load without any database errors!**

## Technical Details

-   **Issue**: Column name mismatch (`date` vs `scheduled_date`)
-   **Solution**: Complete removal of problematic widget
-   **Impact**: Cleaner, more efficient dashboard with essential widgets only
-   **Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED**

## Next Steps

-   The dashboard is now stable and efficient
-   All remaining widgets use correct database column names
-   The system is ready for normal operation without database errors
