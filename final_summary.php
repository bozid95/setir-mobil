echo "=== RESTRUCTURING COMPLETE ===\n\n";

echo "🎯 RESTRUCTURING SUMMARY:\n";
echo "✅ Moved instructor assignments from students to sessions\n";
echo "✅ Added grading functionality to student-session relationships\n";
echo "✅ Enabled flexible instructor scheduling per session\n";
echo "✅ Multiple students can have different instructors across sessions\n\n";

echo "📊 DATABASE STRUCTURE:\n";
echo "• Packages: " . Package::count() . " (training packages)\n";
echo "• Instructors: " . Instructor::count() . " (available instructors)\n";
echo "• Students: " . Student::count() . " (enrolled students)\n";
echo "• Sessions: " . Session::count() . " (session templates with assigned instructors)\n";
echo "• Student Sessions: " . StudentSession::count() . " (actual session enrollments with grades)\n";
echo "• Materials: " . Material::count() . " (learning materials)\n\n";

echo "🔄 NEW WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:\n";

echo "💡 KEY BENEFITS:\n";
echo "✓ Flexible instructor assignment per session\n";
echo "✓ Individual grading and feedback per session\n";
echo "✓ Better resource utilization\n";
echo "✓ Scalable session management\n";
echo "✓ Detailed progress tracking\n\n";

echo "🖥️  ADMIN INTERFACE (Filament):\n";
echo "✓ Session management with instructor selection\n";
echo "✓ Student-session grading interface\n";
echo "✓ Instructor workload distribution\n";
echo "✓ Progress tracking and reporting\n\n";

echo "🗂️  UPDATED MODEL RELATIONSHIPS:\n";
echo "• Instructor → hasMany(Session)\n";
echo "• Session → belongsTo(Instructor)\n";
echo "• Session → belongsToMany(Student) with grading pivot\n";
echo "• Student → belongsToMany(Session) with grading pivot\n";
echo "• Student → belongsTo(Package) [unchanged]\n";
echo "• Package → hasMany(Session) [unchanged]\n\n";

echo "📁 KEY FILES UPDATED:\n";
echo "• Models: Instructor.php, Material.php (fillable fields)\n";
echo "• Database: instructor_id moved from students to sessions\n";
echo "• Grading: score, grade, instructor_feedback added to student_sessions\n";
echo "• Filament: All resources properly configured\n\n";

echo "🚀 SYSTEM READY FOR USE!\n";
echo "The driving school management system has been successfully restructured.\n";
echo "You can now:\n";
echo "1. Assign different instructors to different sessions\n";
echo "2. Grade students individually for each session\n";
echo "3. Provide instructor feedback per session\n";
echo "4. Track student progress across all sessions\n";
echo "5. Manage instructor workloads efficiently\n\n";

echo "To access the admin interface:\n";
echo "1. Run: php artisan serve\n";
echo "2. Visit: http://localhost:8000/admin\n";
echo "3. Login with your admin credentials\n\n";
